Description: Python SNMP library for agents and managers (Python 2 module)
 This  is a  Python implementation  of SNMP  v.1/v.2c/v.3  engine. Its
 general  functionality  is   to  assemble/disassemble  SNMP  messages
 from/into given SNMP Object  IDs along with associated values. PySNMP
 also provides a few transport methods specific to TCP/IP networking.
 .
 PySNMP is written entirely in  Python and is self-sufficient in terms
 that it does not rely on any third party tool (it isn't a wrapper).
 .
 This package provides Python 2 module.
